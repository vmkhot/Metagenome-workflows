# Metagenome-workflows
Welcome! Here I've compiled useful information and scripts on how to deal with metagenomic data. If this has been helpful to you, please share it with your colleagues! All the scripts in this workflow are slurm batch submission scripts for large jobs so that you have an idea of what kind of resources you may require or might be helpful. 

Many scripts are 'for-loops' to be able to process multiple samples at once and for naming them accordingly.

Head to the [wiki](https://github.com/vmkhot/Metagenome-workflows/wiki) for the workflow!
